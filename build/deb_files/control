Description: Prevent your computer from sleeping
 A small indicator to prevent your Linux computer from sleeping. It works by
 creating an icon and a menu where you can choose to inhibit sleep or not. There
 are preferences available to autostart, to start in inhibit mode, and to
 control what Sleep Inhibit does when you're running on battery.
